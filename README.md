# Customer-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis-using-Descriptive-Statistics

# Problem statement
Anlyze the customer behaviour using the dataset available using your knowledge of probability theory and statistics. 

# I have performed below actions in this project.
1. Basic Cleanup
2. calculated measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation) for key variables.
3. Identified variables that could follow specific probability distributions (e.g., Binomial, Normal). Calculated probabilities and expected values based on these distributions.
4. Explored relationships between customer characteristics and spending habits. Segmented customers based on their behaviors and characteristics.
5. Created clear visualizations to showcase my findings. Used insights to make recommendations for the company based on my analysis.
